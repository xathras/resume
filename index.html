            I've been writing software professionally for over 15 years and as a hobby before that. I've worked on everything from large back-end .NET 
            applications to small Rails apps, to Rails based Content Management Systems, to deployment scripts and even a couple of .NET MVC 
            sites. I am well practiced in test driven development and writing tests after the fact for code that I've inherited and needed to change.
            I believe that the key to good software design is clear communication between the business and developers and an understanding of the
            business needs by the development team. Software is never done and must be tended like a garden, including the pulling of weeds.

            Maintain and develop a large (100k loc) software as a service application for funeral home directors. The application is used by over
            30 funeral home chains across the United States to manage funeral arrangements and collaborate with the families of the deceased. By letting
            grieving families fill out paperwork over the web from the privacy of their own home the application helps families through an emotion time in their lives.
            This has the fortunate, but unexpected, side effect of increasing funeral home revenue since when the client does meet with the funeral director they've dealt
            with a lot of the emotion and are able to make more informed and thoughtful decisions. The application was built on ruby-on-rails and CoffeeScript.

            Design and build Rails applications for clients. Work with project managers to determine requirements
            and process flow for multiple projects and continue to maintain projects once published live. Build custom content
            management systems for each client.

          <strong>Example Projects:</strong><br>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://norex.net">https://norex.net</a>: Originally built as a custom CMS on rails 2.3 with a 
                database of documents produced by the company. Upgraded to rails 3.2 and a new CMS while
                preserving existing information. Added a basic forum feature following the Rails upgrade.
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://e-switch.com">https://e-switch.com</a>: Built a custom rails CMS to replace an aging
                .NET Nuke website. Includes a "Configurator" to determine customized electronic switch
                SKUs based on user selections. The configurator includes functionality to exclude some options based on
                invalid combinations of options as determined by the manufacturer. (Example:

            Engage in systems integration work and back-end application development

          <strong>Example Project:</strong><br>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Telecom order processing system to integrate Non-Local telecoms with local providers, Caller ID database, and E911 database.
              During my time on this project I converted the order system from a brittle, hard to use XML based configuration system to
              an MSSQL backed configuration store. Towards the end of my time on the project I started building a .NET desktop application
              to manage these order flow configurations.
