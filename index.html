            I've been writing software professionally for over 12 years and as a hobby before that. I've worked on everything from large back-end .NET 
            applications to small Rails apps, to Rails based Content Management Systems, to deployment scripts and even a couple of .NET MVC 
            sites. I am well practiced in test driven development and writing tests after the fact for code that I've inherited and needed to change.
            I believe that the key to good software design is clear communication between the business and developers and an understanding of the
            business needs by the development team. Software is never done and must be tended like a garden, including the pulling of weeds.

          <h5>April 2009 to the present</h5>
          <p>
            Design and build Rails applications for clients. Work with project managers to determine requirements
            and process flow for multiple projects and continue to maintain projects once published live. Build custom content
            management systems for each client.
          </p>
          <strong>Example Projects:</strong><br>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://norex.net">https://norex.net</a>: Originally built as a custom CMS on rails 2.3 with a 
                database of documents produced by the company. Upgraded to rails 3.2 and a new CMS while
                preserving existing information. Added a basic forum feature following the Rails upgrade.
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://e-switch.com">https://e-switch.com</a>: Built a custom rails CMS to replace an aging
                .NET Nuke website. Includes a "Configurator" to determine customized electronic switch
                SKUs based on user selections. Includes functionality to exclude some options based on
                invalid combinations of options as determined by the manufacturer. (Example:

          <h5>March 2003 to March 2009</h5>
          <p>
            Engage in systems integration work and back-end application development
          </p>
          <strong>Example Project:</strong><br>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Telecom order processing system to integrate Non-Local telecoms with local providers, Caller ID database, and E911 database.
              During my time on this project I converted the order system from a brittle, hard to use XML based configuration system to
              an MSSQL backed configuration store. Towards the end of my time on the project I started building a .NET desktop application
              to manage these order flow configurations.
